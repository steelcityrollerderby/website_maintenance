### What is a Post?

A post is a one-shot informative page. It's usually used to give updates about events coming up, PISA food/drink deals that accompany our bouts, etc. The most recent 5 posts will show up on the front page as seen above.

### Instructions

1. Navigate to the [wp-admin version of the website](http://www.steelcityrollerderby.org/home/wp-admin) and log in.

2. Navigate to [posts](http://www.steelcityrollerderby.org/home/wp-admin/edit.php) to see a list of all of the posts that have been made.

4. Fill in the title and the body of the post (it doesn't have to be super long or anything). IDEALLY you should try to add a picture with every post because it looks better on the front page. Make sure that you select the image radio button in the `Format` box on the right. To upload a picture, click the button near the title area that says `Add Media`.

5. This will open a popup that has all of the media that Steel City Roller Derby has in the Media Library. Click the above `Upload Files` tab to navigate to a location where you can upload the pic that you want to add to the post.

6. Once you're on the new tab, click the `Select Files` button. This'll open the popup on your computer that allows you to choose the files that you want to upload. Upload the picture for the post. Then, click the `Insert into post` button at the bottom right of the page.

7. Once you close the popup and navigate back to the UI, you'll see that the image has been added to the post. Move the photo around (it edits similarly to a Word document).

8. Scroll down the page until you see a box on the right that says `Featured Image.` Click on the link that says `Set featured image`.

9. This will open up a similar popup where you can choose the the `Select Files` button or the `Media Library` tab at the top to choose files from either your computer or from the media library to be the featured image. Choose the picture that you added to the post (or one of the pictures if you added more than one). This will ensure that it shows up on the front page for the post. Once you've chosen one, click the blue button on the bottom right that says `Set featured image`.

10. Once you're done, scroll back up to the top of the page. In the box on the right labeled `Publish`. You can either click the `Save Draft` button to save this post as a draft. You can also preview the way your post is going to look by hitting the `Preview` button. When you're satisfied with it, you can hit the `Publish` button.
