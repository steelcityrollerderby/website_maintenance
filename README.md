# Website Maintenance Documentation:

## What Needs to be Maintained on the Website:

### Regularly:

The only thing that needs to be updated regularly is the [sidebar]().

Sometimes, you might get requests for [posts]() to be made as well.

### Per Season:

1. [Front Page]() (especially [graphics]() for the schedule and the sponsors)
2. [Team Pages]()
3. [New Skater Page]()
4. [Footer]()
