## What parts of this page need to be updated?

There are 2 main parts of this page need to be updated. The first is the promotional graphic that has the bootcamp dates on it.

The second are the bootcamp dates and the links to the Brown Paper Tickets page where people can buy tickets. The date of tryouts for new skaters is also located here!

## How to get to the page that you need to edit:

Navigate to the `Be a Skater` page. First, click the `Pages` button on the left sidebar to navigate to the page that lists all of the pages on the site. Then, type in `Be a Skater` into the search bar on the top right. Click the search button. Then, scan the search results for the page that says `-- Be a Skater | Parent Page: Join SCRD`. ALTERNATIVELY, you just click on [this link](http://www.steelcityrollerderby.org/home/wp-admin/post.php?post=438&action=edit).

## How to update the graphic:

To update the bootcamp schedule graphic, delete the current one that is there (if there is one there) by clicking on it and hitting the `delete` button on your keyboard. If there isn't one, make sure that you have the graphic saved to your computer. **Put the cursor approximately where you want the image to be inserted.** Click the `Add Media` button on the top left to upload the image on your computer.

Once you click the `Add Media` button, a popup will open that will allow you to choose a file from your computer to upload. If you want, you can also click the `Media Library` tab to choose photos that have already been uploaded to WordPress. Once you've chosen a file, click the `Insert into Page` button on the bottom right.

You should see that the graphic has now been inserted into the page. You can put it anywhere, just make sure that it looks good.

## How to update the textual dates:

Once you've got the new graphic in, scroll down until you see the words `Bootcamps and Tryouts`. This is where the text of the dates of the bootcamps (and tryouts) is stored (when we've actually got those scheduled). You'll see a short paragraph that says
```
Potential new skaters must attend one of the following boot camps to learn what will occur during tryouts and get a feel for what is expected of new skaters. You are welcome to attend multiple, but only one is required to attend fresh meat tryouts.
```
I usually put the bootcamp dates after that (but I don't really care where it goes as long as it looks good).

To add a link: 

1. Type out whatever text you want to attach the link to. For example, `Monday, September 4`.
2. Highlight the entirety of the text that you want to make up the link and click the link button on the top.
3. Paste the text of the link to the specific bootcamp / tryout Brown Paper Tickets link into the box.
4. Click the blue Apply button (it has an arrow on it but when you hover over it, it says `Apply`.
5. If you need to change this link because it's fucked up, hover over the text where the link has been attached and click the pencil icon.

## How to publish when you're done:

When you're satisfied with all of your changes, scroll back up and look for the box on the right that says `Publish`. If you want to see what your page is gonna look like after you've made all of your changes, hit `Preview`. Otherwise, hit the blue `Update` button and your changes will be pushed to the live site. Make sure that you check it to verify that everything looks good.
