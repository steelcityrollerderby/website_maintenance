![Screenshot identifying where front page is](https://github.com/steelcityrollerderby/website_maintenance/blob/master/screenshots/update_front_page_screenshots/front_page_identification.png "Front page identification")

1. Navigate to the [wp-admin version of the website](http://www.steelcityrollerderby.org/home/wp-admin) and log in.

2. Go to the sidebar on the left and click `Appearance`. Then, click `Customize` as show below. You could also navigate directly [here](http://www.steelcityrollerderby.org/home/wp-admin/customize.php?return=%2Fhome%2Fwp-admin%2Fwidgets.php).

4. Click `Widgets`
5. Click `Magazine`. We have the main part of the front page in a widget called Magazine. You'll see something that looks like the screenshot below. There are 3 sections. The first section that says `CrumbleMagazine: 1 Column` is the customize detail for the part of the front page that displays the `Recent Posts`. The second section that says `Image` is the schedule graphic. The third section (which also says `Image`) is the sponsor graphic. They are in the order that they are stacked on the website (top to bottom).

6. Make edits:
  - if you want to edit the `Recent Posts` part of the front page, expand the first section. You can edit the title of the section, the number of posts that get shown, and how the images get shown. Click `Done` when you're done.

  - if you want to edit the schedule graphic part of the front page, expand the second section. I didn't add a title because the title looked weird but if you prefer it, def go ahead and add it in! You will also see a preview of what image is being displayed in this section. You can edit the image or replace it entirely (which will need to happen whenever we get a new schedule graphic). The last thing that you can edit is what the image links to. Make sure that it continues to link to the interleague schedule page or something else that makes sense. Click `Done` when you're done.

      - if you want to edit the sponsor graphic part of the front page, expand the third section. I didn't add a title because the title looked weird but if you prefer it, def go ahead and add it in! You will also see a preview of what image is being displayed in this section. You can edit the image or replace it entirely (which will need to happen whenever we get a new sponsor graphic). The last thing that you can edit is what the image links to. Make sure that it continues to link to the main sponsorship page or something else that makes sense. Click `Done` when you're done.

7. When you're satisfied with all of your changes, click the `Publish` button. You should be able to see them updating as a preview while you're making the changes.
